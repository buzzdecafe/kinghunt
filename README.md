# KingHunt

Select a chess problem and solve it in the number of moves stipulated.

For FirefoxOS to start. [Installation page for FirefoxOS](http://buzzdecafe.github.io/kinghunt/)


## To do

* Interface for loading other books or individual problems
* validate FEN (use chess.js validate_fen method, duh)
* ~~add undo button on board~~
* ~~add next problem/previous problem buttons on board~~
* ~~detect when problem successfully solved or when failed~~
* ~~add reload button to board~~
* enable switching between manual mode and AI mode (defer to later version)
* develop better AI! (defer to later version)
* integrate grunt-jasmine-angular
* ~~grunt task to build the firefoxos webapp~~
* mark problems solved and persist somewhere (localStorage? indexedDB?)
* limit book length for performance reasons
* ~~grunt task to add VERSION file in archive~~
* ~~redesign load page with title & logo~~
* show spinner or something while problems load up
* enable pawn-promotion choice (proving trickier than anticipated)
